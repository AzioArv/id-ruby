    Since 2014, I help run the Lambda Jakarta functional programming meetup dedicated to improving developer productivity in Indonesia. I'm passionate about helping people increase their productivity by conquering the most difficult concepts in their field in creative and imaginative ways so that what they've learned stay with them for the rest of their lives. The last talk I gave at Lambda was on "How Giving Talks Is Vital To Your Software Dev Career (BONUS: One Tip To Make It Super Effective)".
