  abstract: |-
    Now, Ruby has several concurrency management features: Threads and Fibers.
    Threads support preemptive context switching and Fibers are for self
    context management. Further more, I proposing new concurrency feature
    "Guild" for Ruby 3. Guild support "isolation" for parallel execution.
    They have advantages and disadvantages. In this talk, I will introduce current features and discuss pros. and
    cons. Also I will show you the new feature "Guild" and why it is needed.
    With this talk, you can understand Ruby's concurrency deeply.
