Hi everyone, we just completely redesign our new website and move from our previous domain: [id-ruby.org](http://id-ruby.org){:target="_blank"} into this shiny, new domain: [ruby.id](http://ruby.id){:target="_blank"}

At our front page, you can see all companies in Indonesia, which use Ruby. If your company isn't listed yet, you can make a pull request to this [repository](http://github.com/id-ruby/id-ruby){:target="_blank"}

Don't forget to check our [meetup](http://meetup.com/jakartarb){:target="_blank"} for coming meetups!.

You may refer to our [twitter](http://twitter.com/id_ruby){:target="_blank"} and [slack](http://tinyurl.com/id-ruby-slack){:target="_blank"} for updates.
